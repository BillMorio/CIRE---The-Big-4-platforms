# Video Production Platform - Project Proposal

## What We're Building

A **semi-automated video editing platform** that streamlines YouTube content creation:

- **Automates:** Script-to-voiceover generation, scene planning, and video assembly
- **Simplifies:** Motion graphics creation through text prompts (no design skills required)
- **Maintains:** Human creative control over visual selection and motion graphics generation with the help of AI

**Target User:** Non-technical content creators who want professional videos without learning complex editing software.

---

## What This Is NOT

This is **not** a fully automated "press a button, get a video" system.

The platform automates the technical/repetitive work while keeping humans in the creative loop for:
- Approving scene visuals
- Refining motion graphic prompts
- Adjusting timing and flow
