Repurposing Workflow - Simple Overview
Step 1: Content Gets Discovered

System scrapes high-performing content from YouTube, Reddit, LinkedIn, Twitter
Stores raw content in Google Sheets

Step 2: AI Analyzes & Creates Blueprint

AI breaks down why the content performed well (hook, structure, storytelling)
Extracts key elements: main ideas, quotes, narrative flow, CTA
Checks if it fits your brand strategy
Creates a structured blueprint and saves it

Step 3: Blueprint Gets Queued for Repurposing

Approved blueprints move to the repurposing queue
System knows which formats you want (Twitter thread, LinkedIn post, etc.)

Step 4: AI Transforms Content

AI reads the blueprint + your brand voice profile
Generates multiple format versions in parallel
Each format follows platform-specific best practices
Applies your brand's tone, style, and vocabulary

Step 5: Human Review

Generated content appears in Google Sheets review queue
You edit, approve, or reject
Add scheduling details

Step 6: Auto-Publishing

n8n checks for approved content on schedule
Posts to respective platforms automatically
Tracks performance metrics
Performance data feeds back to improve future content selection

The Loop: High performers get discovered → Analyzed → Repurposed in your voice → Published → Performance tracked → Informs what to discover next
